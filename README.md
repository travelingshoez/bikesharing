# NYC bike-sharing
Introduction of the statistical analysis:
- Certain criteria must be visible for streamlined maintenance of bikes, seeing peak times, and which gender used the bikes the most. Hence, why the analysis was conducted. 


Analysis
- The analysis drew concrete conclusions. First, we pinpointed peak weekdays and times users utilized the bicycles. Second, we are now able to establish which bikes require maintenance and replacement. Lastly, a plan to meet the high demand can be met with the right volume at the right time.  



Conclusion 
- Overall, the team can plan more accordingly by establishing three tangents, What is needed, How much is needed, and most importatant when is it needed.
